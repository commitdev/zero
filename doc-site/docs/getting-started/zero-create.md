The `zero create` command renders the infrastructure modules you've configured into your project folder and pushes your code to GitHub.

```shell
# Template the selected modules and configuration specified in zero-project.yml and push to the repository.
$ cd zero-init   # change your working dir to YOUR_PROJECT_NAME
$ zero create

✅  Repository created: github.com/myapp-org/frontend
✅  Done - run zero apply to create any required infrastructure or execute any other remote commands to prepare your environments.


```

After this step you will be able to examine the created repositories before proceeding to `zero apply`. If you chose not to have zero create a repository for you, you can still use the `zero apply` command to create the infrastructure but you will need to check these repositories into your version control system of choice.

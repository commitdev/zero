The `zero apply` command takes the templated modules generated based on your input and spins up a scalable & performant infrastructure for you!

:::note
This can take 20 minutes or more depending on your choices, as it must wait for all the provisioned infrastructure to be created
:::

```shell
$ zero apply

# Sample Output
Choose the environments to apply. This will create infrastructure, CI pipelines, etc.
At this point, real things will be generated that may cost money!
Only a single environment may be suitable for an initial test, but for a real system we suggest setting up both staging and production environments.
